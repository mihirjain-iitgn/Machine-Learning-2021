#### Theoretical

##### Discrete Input

- The work done at each depth is O(mn) and the depth is atmost m. So, complexity for training is O(m^2*n).

- For predicting, a the time is proportional to the depth of the tree. So, complexity for testing is O(m) per row.

##### Real Input

- The work done at each depth is O(mnlogn) and the depth is atmost n. So, complexity for training is O(m*n^2logn).

- For predicting, a the time is proportional to the depth of the tree. So, complexity for testing is O(n) per row.

#### Comparison

The testing plots appear to linearly increasing with m and n which matches with the theoretical estimation.

The training plots for the discrete inputs increase more with m is increased as the lines are farer than in the case of real inputs.

In the case of real inputs, there appears to a steaper increase with an increase in n.

The above two observations also match with the theoretical analysis.
