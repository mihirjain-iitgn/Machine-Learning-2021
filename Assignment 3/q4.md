### Logistic Regression :

Say Input has shape (n,m) and ouput has k classes.
A matrix of shape (m,k) is learned in Logistic Regression.

### Time Complexity

#### Training :

For each epoch
- The prediction is calculated: Matrix multiplcation of X and parameters. O(n*m*k)
- Softmax : O(n*k)
- Gradient Computation Matrix Multiplication of X.T and (y_hat - y_true). O(n*m*k)(Here y_true is one-hot)
- Parameters Update : O(m*k)

Overall : O(n*m*k) per epoch  

#### Testing :

Only prediction step : O(n*m*k)

### Space Complexity
- O(m*n) is the space requirement for storing the input.
- O(m*k) space will be required to store the parameters.
- An Intermediate matrix is created while computing gradients. That requires space O(n*k).
